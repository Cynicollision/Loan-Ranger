This repository contains an Android application that was created for an undergraduate course project. It was co-devleoped between myself and two classmates in our CS-4XX "Android development" class. 

This repository is neither stable nor an ongoing project. I keep it purely for nostalgia and in homage to the vast number of hours spent hacking it together. And it didn't crash during our final presentation/demo like the other team's did :).
